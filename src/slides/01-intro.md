# What’s GatsbyJS
![Gatsby Logo](./gatsby-logo.png)

- Gatsby is a free and open source developer framework
- Based on React
- Generates Static instances of websites and apps

---

# Why a static website?
- Static site generators pre-generate all the pages of the website
- No more live database querying and no more running through a template engine
- Performance goes up and the maintenance cost goes down
